# ðŸ’Š Pill-Dispenser ðŸ’Š

The pill dispenser utilizes an Arduino Leonardo Board, a computer camera for facial recognition, a MyoWare muscle sensor for authorization, a TMP36 temperature sensor for monitoring, and a servo motor for dispensing pills. Its purpose is to benefit elders or those with physical limitations who cannot open pill cases by themselves.

- Facial Recognition: We incorporate facial recognition technology to ensure that only authorized users can access their prescription medication, adding a layer of security and personalization.
- Muscle Sensor: A muscle sensor is integrated to detect muscle contractions, making pill dispensing effortless for individuals with reduced muscle strength or dexterity.
- Temperature Sensor: The inclusion of a temperature sensor ensures medication quality by monitoring environmental conditions within the pill casing.
